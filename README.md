- Developed a predictive model for flight prices using a RandomForestRegressor, achieving an R² score of 0.806 with 100,000+ records
 -Performed Pre-processing of data, EDA to identify meaningful insights 
 -Performed extensive outlier detection and mitigation, identifying 94 outliers in the dataset and adjusting extreme values to the median price. to improve model accuracy.
-Applied feature selection using mutual information regression, identifying key features contributing to price prediction.
-Optimized model hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV, leading to a best score of 0.821.
-Automated model evaluation with custom metrics, including MAPE of 13.30%, and created streamlined training and prediction pipelines.
