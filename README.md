✈️ Flight Price Prediction
A machine learning project to predict flight prices using a Random Forest Regressor, built with over 100,000 records.

🔍 Project Highlights
Developed a predictive model for flight prices using RandomForestRegressor, achieving an R² score of 0.806.

Performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights.

Conducted extensive outlier detection and mitigation, identifying 94 outliers and adjusting extreme values to the median, improving model accuracy.

Applied feature selection using mutual information regression to identify key drivers of price.

Optimized model hyperparameters with RandomizedSearchCV, improving R² to 0.821.

Automated model evaluation with custom metrics:

MAPE: 13.30%

Streamlined training and prediction pipelines for reproducibility and deployment.
